        Superheroes are strong, inspiring individuals who are using their talent to do good for the world. 
        They promote well intentioned messages about standing up for peers and protecting others. 
        Since our childhood we were always inspired by our favorite superheroes and this is what made us come up with this idea.
        World of superheroes is a place where one can find all the necessary information about the searched superhero. 
        We aim to provide all the details of superhero such as the weight, height, intelligence, strength, etc. 
        We want to create a space where one can also compare the two superheroes attributes and 
        learn more about their favorite superhero on few clicks.
